The Node.js API, powered by Express.js, is a basic RESTful API that allows clients to interact with a SQL Server database. This API follows the principles of REST architecture, providing a simple and intuitive way to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

Using Express.js, the API sets up the necessary routes and endpoints to handle incoming requests. It supports standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, which map to the corresponding database operations.

The SQL Server database is used as the data storage layer, allowing data to be persisted and retrieved. Through the API, clients can fetch specific resources, create new records, update existing data, and delete records from the database.

This easy-to-use API can serve as a foundation for building more complex applications and can be extended to include additional features and functionalities based on specific requirements. It provides a seamless integration between Node.js, SQL Server, and Express.js, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to quickly build a basic RESTful API with a familiar tech stack.
